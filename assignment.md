Rules
--------

You may use online libraries, resources, and tools to help you with your assignment. You may make use of any 3rd or 1st party libraries you wish. The only thing you may not do is copy code wholesale from the internet. I understand that an amount of code may be similar to resources you consulted online, and this is no problem, but large scale plagiarism will be dealt with drastically and may result in a mark of 0, or worse, disciplinary action from the exam board.

Marking Breakdown
--------

- 40% of marks are for core functionality.
- 10% of marks are for clean, organized code.
- 10% of marks are for your own flair / design. (Nothing excessive is necessary).


Requirements
--------

Your app should have two sections / screens:
- Main screen (search for city, display conditions).
- 5 Day Forecast screen.

Your weather app must provide the following functionality:
- Must be able to type in a city name and retrieve the weather data for it. **(10%)**
- Must be able to display the temperature, humidity, and wind speed for the current day. **(10%)**
- Must be able to display the current weather conditions (eg: sunny, rainy, cloudy) using some graphical representation (icons, colors, etc, you are free to implement this how you wish). **(10%)**
- Must be able to display a 5 day forecast for Dublin in a UITableView. (or UICollectionView!). [If you like, you can make it display a 5 day forecast for the city you searched for, rather than Dublin] **(10%)**


Resources
--------

You can use [OpenWeather](http://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data. You will need to sign up for an API key (free). You will need to consult the documentation to discover how to use the service.

You can use [AFNetworking](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking) to make network requests.
